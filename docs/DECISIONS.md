# Architecture Decisions

Log of significant design and architecture decisions. Append new entries at the bottom.

### 001 — Multi-module Maven structure
**Date**: 2026-05  
**Decision**: Split gametime-service into `gametime-api` (generated stubs) and `gametime-app` (hand-written code).  
**Rationale**: Keeps generated OpenAPI code isolated from application logic. The api module is a pure build artifact — no hand-written code lives there. The app module depends on it as a Maven dependency.  
**Alternatives considered**: Single module with generated sources in target/ (simpler but generated and hand-written code mixed in IDE).

### 002 — OpenAPI delegate pattern
**Date**: 2026-05  
**Decision**: Use `delegatePattern=true` in openapi-generator-maven-plugin.  
**Rationale**: Generated controller delegates to a hand-written `V1ApiDelegate` implementation. This means we never touch generated controller code — the delegate is the integration point.

### 003 — Postgres for local dev, H2 for tests
**Date**: 2026-05  
**Decision**: Local development runs against Postgres in Docker. `mvn test` uses H2 in-memory with no Docker dependency.  
**Rationale**: Postgres for local dev gives realistic behavior (triggers, schemas, data types). H2 for tests keeps the test suite fast and CI-friendly with zero infrastructure.  
**Trade-off**: Liquibase changesets must be dual-compatible. Postgres-specific SQL gated with `dbms:postgresql`.

### 004 — Dedicated gametime schema
**Date**: 2026-05  
**Decision**: All application tables live in the `gametime` schema, not `public`.  
**Rationale**: Clean separation from system tables. H2 supports schemas, so this works in both environments.

### 005 — JDK 21 LTS via SDKMAN
**Date**: 2026-05  
**Decision**: Target Java 21 (SDKMAN: `21.0.9-tem`). Do not use Homebrew JDK 25.  
**Rationale**: Lombok 1.18.x is incompatible with JDK 25. JDK 21 is the current LTS release. All Maven commands must set `JAVA_HOME` explicitly.

### 006 — Attribute-driven skill calculation
**Date**: 2026-05 (pre-existing design)  
**Decision**: 16 raw player attributes feed into 13 derived skill calculations via weighted formulas with threshold bonuses/penalties.  
**Rationale**: Attributes are the "DNA" of a player — stable, slowly changing. Skills are the observable output — what a player can actually do on the court. This two-tier model allows the same attribute profile to produce different skill outcomes based on formula tuning.

### 007 — Cucumber on JUnit 5 Platform
**Date**: 2026-05  
**Decision**: Migrated from JUnit 4 vintage to JUnit 5 Platform (`@Suite` + `cucumber-junit-platform-engine`).  
**Rationale**: JUnit 4 vintage engine is deprecated. JUnit 5 Platform is the standard runner. Removed junit-vintage-engine dependency.
