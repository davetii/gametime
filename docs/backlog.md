# Backlog

Loose tactical chores with **no phase home** — infra/tooling/data-hygiene work
that isn't a product feature and so doesn't belong in a roadmap phase. This file
is stable across phases (unlike [todo.md](todo.md), which is rewritten each phase
to track only the current one).

For deferred *gameplay* scope (sim-fidelity events the engine doesn't model yet),
see the **§3.x Deferred sim-fidelity details** section of [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)
— those have a phase home and live with the phase that will consume them.

- [ ] Hand-tune marquee/star players to 18–20 where appropriate (the rescale was
      mechanical). Deferred until the game engine shows whether it matters.
- [ ] Evaluate Testcontainers as an alternative to H2 for integration tests.
- [ ] Separate test seed data from production seed. Today both the `local`
      (Postgres) and test (H2) profiles load the *same* Liquibase changelog
      (`db/changelog.yml` → `players.csv`, `roster.csv`, `release.1.0.1.dataload.sql`),
      so tests assert against production seed rows. Runtime league changes (trades,
      new signings) only touch Postgres and don't affect tests, but *editing the seed
      files* can break tests that hardcode team IDs / sizes. Introduce a small fixed
      test-only fixture (e.g. `test/resources/db/` changelog the test profile points
      at) so `main/resources/db/` can evolve for production independently. Interim
      mitigation done: roster-rule tests in `RosterLineupDelegateTest` now sign their
      own players instead of assuming seed roster sizes; remaining brittleness is the
      hardcoded team IDs themselves.
