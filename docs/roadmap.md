# Gametime Project Plan

Basketball simulation game — 40-team league with attribute-driven gameplay, season management, and a React frontend.

_Last updated: 2026-07-10_

## What Exists Today

### Shipped
- **21 player attributes**: agility, awareness, aggression, charisma, cohesion, composure, determination, ego, endurance, energy, handle, health, intelligence, luck, shotSelection, shotSkill, size, speed, strength, verticality, wingspan
- **23 derived skills** on a 1–20 / avg-10 scale via a shared deviation helper: acumen, ballSecurity, passing, teamOffense, drive, freeThrows, longRange, perimeter, post, individualDefense, teamDefense, offenseRebound, defenseRebound, finishing, transition, rimProtection, stealing, shotContest, foulDrawing, foulProne, clutch, screenSetting, offBallMovement
- **9 positions**: PG, CG, SG, W, SF, F, PF, FC, C
- **Player status** (availability): ACTIVE, INJURED, SUSPENDED. Lineup slot is a
  separate `lineupRole` (STARTER, ROTATION, BENCH, INACTIVE, MINORS) on the
  roster assignment — see decisions.md #013.
- **40-team league** across 4 conferences (EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST), 422 seed players (CSV-driven via Liquibase)
- **Entity layer**: Player, Team, Coach (5 decision attributes — #018), GM (name only); player↔team decoupled via `player_team` + `player_team_hist`
- **Roster & lineup model**: a team's roster is part of the `Team` resource (`players` are roster entries with lineup slot); lineup (starting 5 + bench rotation order) is sticky state on `player_team`; player status (availability) is separate from lineup role; roster size caps (15 active / 5 minors) enforced on sign + lineup, signed players default to `INACTIVE`. Roster construction is unconstrained by position — no position minimums/maximums (#017). See decisions.md #013–#017.
- **REST endpoints**: GET league, GET player by ID + history, createPlayer, updatePlayer; GET team by ID (incl. roster), addPlayerToTeam, removePlayerFromTeam, set lineup
- **Skill calculation engine**: SkillCalculator interface, 23 calculator implementations, SkillMapper orchestrator
- **Entity-to-model mapping**: EntityMapper with full attribute + skill wiring
- **Database**: Postgres (local dev) + H2 (tests), Liquibase migrations, gametime schema, audit triggers
- **Test suite**: unit + Cucumber integration, 80% line coverage enforced (JaCoCo gate)
- **Build pipeline**: Multi-module Maven, OpenAPI codegen with delegate pattern, Docker Compose

### Deferred
- **GM attributes** — the name-only `GM` slot stays until its consumers are real
  (Phase 6.3 draft scouting / 6.4 trade evaluation). Resolve with the same
  continuous 1–20 model as coach (decisions.md #018); see coach.md open-Q #3.
  *(Coach attributes — done: Design Decision #3 resolved as #018, modeled
  end-to-end; see Shipped above.)*
- **Player age** — only `yearsPro` is modeled; no birth date / true age yet.
  `yearsPro` is sufficient for everything built so far; true age gains a consumer
  at Phase 6.1 (aging & development — attribute peak/decline curves), where the
  full date-of-birth model belongs.

## Phase 3 — Game Simulation Engine

**Goal**: Build the core possession-by-possession simulation.

### 3.1 Game Model ✓
- [x] Define `Game` entity: homeTeam, awayTeam, quarter structure, final score
- [x] Define `GameEvent` model: possessions, plays, outcomes
- [x] Define `BoxScore` model: per-player stats for a single game

_Shipped: `GameEntity` / `GameEventEntity` / `BoxScoreEntity` + repos, Liquibase
`release.1.0.4.game.sql`, persistence-only (no API surface — §3.6). See
decisions.md #020 and game.md for the modeling choices._

### 3.2 Possession Engine ✓
- [x] Possession flow: inbound → set play / fast break → shot clock → outcome
- [x] Shot selection logic: which player gets the ball, what type of shot (drive, perimeter, post, longRange)
- [x] Shot outcome: probability based on shooter skills vs defender skills
- [x] Turnover probability: ballSecurity vs defender individualDefense
- [x] Foul model: drive/post attempts → foul probability → freeThrow skill

_Shipped: `sim` package — `GameSimulator` @Service (transactional simulate()),
`PossessionEngine` (pure-sim loop), `ShotResolver`/`TurnoverResolver`/`FoulResolver`
(logistic-contest math per decisions.md #021), `ShotSelector` (skill-weighted),
`SimConfig` (all constants in one place for §3.4 tuning). Seeded RNG for
determinism. Missed shot ends possession (rebounding seam for §3.3). Starters
play the whole game (minutes/fatigue is §3.5). Assists left at 0 (§3.4).
Constants are placeholder starting points; §3.4 calibrates empirically._

### 3.3 Rebounding ✓
- [x] Offensive rebound probability: offenseRebound skills vs defenseRebound skills
- [x] Second-chance possessions

_Shipped: `ReboundResolver` @Component in the `sim` package (logistic-contest
`isOffensiveRebound()` per decisions.md #021 shape; skill-weighted
`pickOffensiveRebounder()`/`pickDefensiveRebounder()` mirroring `ShotSelector`).
`PossessionEngine.resolvePossession()` now resolves a rebound after every missed
shot: a `DEFENSIVE` rebound ends the possession, an `OFFENSIVE` rebound runs a
second-chance possession through the full flow (turnover → foul → shot), capped
at `SimConfig.MAX_OFFENSIVE_REBOUNDS_PER_POSSESSION` (a loop, not recursion).
`PlayType.REBOUND` is now live (outcomes `OFFENSIVE`/`DEFENSIVE`); box-score
offensive/defensive rebound counts are real (no longer hardcoded 0). Coach/
chemistry modifiers (§3.4), fatigue (§3.5), blocks, and team box-out are
deliberately out of scope — raw `offenseRebound` vs `defenseRebound` skills only.
`BASE_OFFENSIVE_REBOUND` is a placeholder (~0.27); §3.4 calibrates empirically._

### 3.4 Team Chemistry & Coaching Effects ✓
- [x] teamOffense/teamDefense affect overall team efficiency
- [x] Passing skill influences assist rate and ball movement
- [x] Acumen influences shot selection quality
- [x] Coach system modifies possession pace, shot distribution, defensive scheme
- [x] Rebalance skill calculator formulas once possessions exercise them
      (calibrated empirically against modern-NBA benchmarks)

_Shipped (decisions.md #022): coach + chemistry modifiers layered onto the §3.2/
§3.3 flow as a thumb on the scale, plus the deferred empirical calibration pass.
All effects use the avg-10 deviation multiplier `base × (1 + COACH_SENSITIVITY ×
(attr−10)/10)`. `CoachModifiers` value object turns a `Coach` into pace / shot-mix
/ defensive-pressure multipliers (reads `pace`/`offensiveScheme`/`defensiveScheme`
ONLY — rotation attrs are §3.5); a `TeamContext` (players + modifiers) threads
them through `PossessionEngine` without re-churning signatures. **pace scales the
possession count**, offensiveScheme leans the `ShotSelector` shot-type draw,
defensiveScheme scales turnover/foul pressure. `PlayerGameState` now extracts
`teamOffense`/`teamDefense`/`passing`/`acumen`: `acumen` is a small make-rate nudge
+ `teamOffense`/`teamDefense` a possession-level efficiency multiplier in
`ShotResolver` (Decision C). **Assists are now real (Decision B1)**: a made FG may
be assisted (rolled from the supporting cast's passing), the assister picked by a
weighted passing draw over the other four and stamped on a new nullable
`game_event.assist_player_id` column (first schema change since §3.1; OpenAPI
deferred to §3.6); `BoxScore.assists` reconciles against assisted-SHOT events
(#020). A disabled-by-default `CalibrationHarness` simulates ~100 games and reports
aggregates; `SimConfig` base rates were tuned to land near ~112 pts / 47% FG / 36%
3P / 26 ast / 14 TO per team. Minutes/fatigue (§3.5) stays out of scope — starters
play the whole game._

### 3.5 Minutes, Fatigue & Substitution ✓
*(gameplay, not roster — minutes/fatigue/coach rotation are produced by games
being played. Input: the `rotationOrder` bench depth chart already shipped in
the roster domain, #014.)*
- [x] Minutes allocation: bench `rotationOrder` → distribution of playing time
- [x] Per-player energy tracking within a game (`endurance` ↔ minutes played)
- [x] Skill degradation as energy drops
- [x] Automatic substitution triggers based on fatigue thresholds
- [x] Coach rotation style determines when subs happen (gated on Coach model)

_Shipped (decisions.md #023): the on-floor five is now **dynamic** — bench players
enter, fatigue accumulates, and the coach's `rotationDepth` /
`substitutionAggressiveness` (the two attributes §3.4 deliberately left unread)
drive substitutions. A new `RotationState` (per team, held by `TeamContext`) owns
the full squad + the current five, exposes `onFloor()` (always exactly 5), and runs
a **between-possession** sub step in `PossessionEngine.simulate()`: drain on-floor
energy (scaled by `endurance`), recover the benched, force off any fouled-out player,
then run a fatigue sub (most-tired starter below a `substitutionAggressiveness`-scaled
threshold → freshest bench within `rotationDepth`; starters pulled later / return
first). The step is **deterministic given (energy, fouls, coach attrs) and consumes
no RNG** — the §3.4 seed-pinned stream only shifts because the five now change.
`PlayerGameState` gained `currentEnergy` (drain/recover, flat full-tank start) + an
on-floor-possession accumulator; a single `fatigueFactor(energy)` multiplier bends
each contest skill (shot/turnover/foul/rebound), composed multiplicatively with the
§3.4 modifiers. **Minutes are real** (`BoxScore.minutes`): a possession-share
projection (no game clock, #021), and **every player who took the floor gets a
box-score row** — team minutes sum to 5 × game-minutes. **Foul-outs** (`FOUL_OUT_LIMIT
= 6`) are a **derived predicate** over the existing foul counter (no stored flag),
forcing a sub from the full roster; the floor never drops below 5. §3.5 is
**schema-free** (within-game fatigue only; `box_score.minutes` already existed). The
`CalibrationHarness` was extended with per-slot minutes + period FG% reporting; the
§3.4 aggregates held with fatigue on (112.4 pts / 47.2% FG / 35.4% 3P / 27.6 ast /
13.4 TO) and the minutes curve lands on target (top starter ~37, none over ~42)._

### 3.6 Simulation APIs ✓
- [x] `POST /v1/game/simulate` — simulate a single game, return box score
- [x] `GET /v1/game/{gameId}` — retrieve game result
- [x] `GET /v1/game/{gameId}/play-by-play` — event log
- [x] Decide + migrate a stored per-event **time column** for play-by-play
      display — **closed as _derived-on-read_ (no column), not built** (#024 E);
      revisit trigger is the Phase 7 game view

_Shipped (decisions.md #024): the persisted engine is now exposed over OpenAPI —
`POST /v1/game/simulate`, `GET /v1/game/{gameId}`, `GET .../play-by-play` — as
**API + read-projection + entity→model mapping only** (no engine change). Both
simulate and get return a shared **`GameResult`** (`game` + home/away box scores):
the box scores are **split server-side** by resolving each `box_score` row's team
via `player_team` (the row has no `team_id`, #020) — one `findByTeamId` roster
lookup buckets the rows in a new `EntityMapper` mapping (the net-new work; the crux).
Play-by-play is a **flat sequence-ordered `[GameEvent]`, no pagination** (#024 D),
surfacing `assistPlayerId`. **Seed** is optional in / random default / **persisted**
(`game.seed BIGINT` — the ONE schema change, appended to the unreleased
`release.1.0.4.game.sql`, #024 B) and echoed on the `Game` header. Pace stays
internal (#024 C). Errors: 404 unknown game/team (engine already throws), a **new
422** (`ResourceUnprocessableException`) for the same-team guard (#024 F). No
per-event time column — derived on read (#024 E), so `game.seed` is the only schema
change. **Impl note:** to avoid a `GametimeServiceImp ↔ GameSimulator` constructor
cycle (the simulator needed a team lookup that lived on the top-level service), the
"load a team with its roster" logic was extracted into a focused `TeamQueryService`
both sides depend on — an acyclic, one-way graph, no `@Lazy`. Touched packages land
at 99–100% line coverage._

### Possession-fidelity completion (§3.7–§3.11) — before Phase 4

Real-basketball events the §3.2/§3.3 engine does **not** model yet. Originally
parked as "§3.x deferred sim-fidelity details," now **promoted to numbered
sub-phases and scheduled ahead of Phase 4** (decision 2026-07): the goal of Phase 3
is a complete possession engine, and shipping Phase 4 stats on a knowingly-thin
engine means the first leaderboards describe an incomplete game (a blocks leader of
all zeros, slightly-low scoring, a two-value turnover taxonomy).

**Each is its own sub-phase with its own design pass** — the §3.4/§3.5/§3.6
three-session workflow (a numbered `decisions.md` entry + an execute-ready
`todo.md` plan, then execution). These bullets are *seams, not plans*: the blocks
discussion showed the one-line description under-specified the real design (the
"block only on misses" shortcut was rejected in favor of a block-gates-the-make
model). Do **not** execute a bullet without running its design pass first.

**Sequenced by calibration blast radius, not roadmap order.** The `CalibrationHarness`
guards ~112 pts / 47% FG / 36% 3P / 26 ast / 14 TO per team (§3.4). Some items are
pure event-log *labeling* (no effect on those numbers); others move scoring and cost
a recalibration pass. Ordering isolates the scoring-affecting changes so each lands
against a known-good baseline instead of tuning against two moving point-sources at
once. The harness **reports**, it does not gate the build — "recalibration" means
re-running the loop and re-agreeing the numbers, not a red build.

> **Shared dependency:** §3.10 and §3.11 both need a **team-foul / bonus model**
> that does not exist yet (foul counts per team per period → bonus free throws).
> They're adjacent so that substrate is designed and built once.

- [ ] **§3.7 — Blocked shots** *(own recalibration; the pilot — already
      half-designed)*. No `BLOCK` play type today; a blocked shot is
      indistinguishable from a normal miss (becomes a `MISSED SHOT` → rebound) and
      `BoxScore.blocks` is hardcoded 0 (`GameSimulator` sets `bs.setBlocks(0)`).
      **Design-pass fork (from discussion):** the roadmap's original "roll a block
      only on shots that already missed" is **rejected** — a real block *prevents a
      would-be make*, so the block roll must **gate the make/miss roll**, not garnish
      misses. Options: (2) a block gate *before* the existing `isMade` roll — if
      blocked, emit `BLOCK`, no make roll, rebound as normal; or (3) fold into a
      three-way `MAKE`/`MISS`/`BLOCK` outcome. **Defensive block skill is a
      first-class factor** (`rimProtection` for rim attempts, `shotContest` for
      jumpers, scaled by shot type; optional shooter counter-factor via `shotSkill`/
      finishing). Watch the **double-count trap**: the defender's block contribution
      must be removed from the make roll or elite rim protectors get penalized twice.
      Because blocks now convert would-be makes, scoring drops slightly → one
      recalibration (nudge rim make-rate up to compensate). Seam: `ShotResolver` +
      `PossessionEngine` shot branch; add a blocks-per-team target (~5) to the harness.
      The flow is drawn in `docs/possession-flow.puml` (the `BLOCKED?` fork inside
      `ShotResolver`, before the make roll, falling through to `ReboundResolver`) —
      marked PROPOSED / not built.
      **Open questions to resolve in the design pass (#025 TBD):**
      1. *Fork shape* — Option 2 (block gate before the existing `isMade` roll) vs.
         Option 3 (one three-way `MAKE`/`MISS`/`BLOCK` draw). Option 3 avoids the
         double-count by construction; Option 2 is the smaller diff.
      2. *Double-count split* — how the defender's `rimProtection`/`shotContest` is
         divided between "got a hand on it (block)" and "contested it into a miss
         (make roll)" so elite rim protectors aren't taxed twice and interior
         scoring doesn't crater. (The reason a real recalibration is needed.)
      3. *Shooter counter-factor* — does a great finisher / high `shotSkill` get
         blocked less, or is v1 defender-only?
      4. *Block-recovery outcomes* — a blocked ball gets its **own `BlockResolver`**
         (not a bias on the normal rebound draw — that hack is dropped) with a
         three-way roll: recovered-by-offense (→ second-chance) / recovered-by-defense
         (possession over) / out-of-bounds. Driven by block-specific factors (how
         hard/controlled the swat was), NOT `offenseRebound` vs `defenseRebound`.
         Sub-question: OOB off the shooter (defense's ball) vs off the blocker
         (offense retains) — v1 simplest is "block-OOB = defense's ball." Set the
         three probabilities (defense-lean: real blocks favor the blocking team).
      5. *Offense-recovered-block loop re-entry* — when the offense recovers a
         blocked ball it re-enters the second-chance path (counts against
         `MAX_OFFENSIVE_REBOUNDS_PER_POSSESSION`). Decide whether it **skips**
         `ReboundResolver`'s draw (recovery already decided by `BlockResolver`) or
         falls through it — must not double-decide who got the ball.
      6. *Block rate by shot type* — rim attempts (`DRIVE`/`POST`) are blocked far
         more than jumpers; `THREE` blocks are rare. Confirm the per-`ShotType` base
         rates and the ~5/team/game target.
- [ ] **§3.8 — Missed shot out of bounds (no rebound)** *(free — no recalibration)*.
      A missed shot that sails OOB untouched, or a rebound tipped OOB, ends the
      possession the same as a defensive rebound — today folded into the
      `REBOUND — DEFENSIVE` outcome. Add as a third branch off the rebound roll
      (retained inbound vs lost inbound). Pure event-log labeling: the possession
      outcome is unchanged, so harness totals don't move.
- [ ] **§3.9 — Turnover sub-categories (richer causes)** *(free — no recalibration)*.
      §3.2 models only two turnover outcomes — `STOLEN` / `LOST_BALL` — and §3.4 kept
      it that way. A fuller taxonomy: offensive fouls (charges), **shot-clock
      violations**, bad passes, travels, out-of-bounds, 3-seconds, 8-second/backcourt.
      **Modeling approach (important — do NOT reverse decisions.md #021):** each
      sub-category is a new **`outcome` value on a `TURNOVER` `GameEvent`** (the
      `outcome` field is open-ended free text, #020 — so **no schema change**)
      produced by a **probability roll**, exactly like the existing `BASE_TURNOVER`
      model — NOT by simulating a sub-possession 24-second clock or ball-tracking.
      E.g. a shot-clock violation is a small per-possession chance (scaled by weak
      `teamOffense` / low `acumen` / a stalling `defensiveScheme`) emitting `TURNOVER`
      / `SHOT_CLOCK_VIOLATION`; a charge is `TURNOVER` / `OFFENSIVE_FOUL`. The
      turnover *count* is unchanged (you're subdividing the ~14 the harness already
      likes), so no recalibration. Seam: `TurnoverResolver` + `SimConfig`.
- [ ] **§3.10 — Loose-ball / rebounding fouls** *(needs the team-foul/bonus
      substrate; small recalibration)*. A foul committed *during* the rebound phase
      (box-out push, over-the-back). §3.3 only models shooting fouls on drive/post
      attempts; the rebound contest is foul-free. When added, it's a foul roll on the
      rebound contest → non-shooting foul (possession retained, or **bonus free
      throws** once the team-foul/bonus model exists). Adds FT volume only if bonus
      FTs are in scope → re-check FT rate in the harness. **Build the team-foul/bonus
      model here** (shared with §3.11).
- [ ] **§3.11 — And-1 / shooting foul on a made basket** *(biggest recalibration)*.
      Today a foul check happens *instead of* a shot (`PossessionEngine`: the foul
      branch returns before the make/miss roll — drive/post → foul → 2 FTs, never
      *with* a made shot). A real and-1 is: made FG **+** 1 bonus free throw. Needs
      the foul model to roll **alongside** (not before) shot resolution — the more
      invasive change, restructuring the possession branching. Adds points to the
      system (bonus FTs that don't exist today) → pushes pts above ~112 → re-tune
      `BASE_FOUL` / FT rate to re-center. Reuses the team-foul/bonus substrate from
      §3.10.

_(A future defensive-fidelity or Phase-4 stats pass may surface more; add new
numbered sub-phases here rather than reopening a catch-all deferred bucket.)_

---

## Phase 6 — Player Progression & Off-Season

**Goal**: Multi-season continuity with player development and aging.

### 6.1 Aging & Development
- [ ] Define age curves: when do attributes peak and decline?
- [ ] Young players: attribute growth between seasons based on yearsPro, determination, intelligence
- [ ] Veterans: gradual physical decline (speed, agility, energy) offset by mental gains (intelligence, shotSelection)
- [ ] Breakout/bust probability for young players

### 6.2 Injury System

- [ ] Trade logic: player-for-player, picks, salary matching
- [ ] GM attributes influence trade evaluation (model as continuous 1–20 like
      coach #018 — see coach.md open-Q #3)

---

## Phase 7 — React Frontend

**Goal**: Browser-based UI for viewing and interacting with the simulation.

### 7.1 Core Views

- [ ] Coach hiring/firing between seasons
- [ ] GM hiring/firing
- [ ] Player morale/chemistry system (charisma, cohesion, ego interactions)
- [ ] Home court advantage modifier
- [ ] Rivalry bonuses
- [ ] Pre-season / exhibition games
- [ ] All-Star game
- [ ] Export/import save state

---

## Design Decisions To Make

These are open questions that should be resolved before or during implementation:

1. **Simulation granularity**: Possession-by-possession (detailed, slow) vs. quarter-level (faster, less detail) vs. configurable?
2. **Game clock model**: Real seconds ticking down, or abstract possession count per quarter?
3. **Coach attribute design**: Continuous attributes (1-10 scale like players) or categorical styles (enum-based)?
4. **Salary/contract complexity**: Simple (flat salary, fixed years) or realistic (cap exceptions, bird rights, max contracts)?
5. **Draft class generation**: Fully random, template-based archetypes, or a mix?
6. **Frontend-first or API-first for new features?**: Build APIs then UI, or design UI mockups first?
7. **Real-time simulation**: Should game simulation stream play-by-play via WebSocket, or generate all at once and let the frontend replay?
8. **Multi-user**: Is this single-player (user controls one team) or spectator-mode (AI runs everything, user watches)?
9. **Persistence strategy for game events**: Store every possession in the DB, or only final box scores?
10. **Season length**: How many games per team per season? (NBA is 82 — that's a lot of simulation data)

## Suggested Build Order

The phases above are roughly sequential, but here's the critical path:

```
[Foundation ✓] ──> Phase 2 (Rosters) ✓ ──> Coach model ✓ ──> Phase 3 (Game Engine) ──> Phase 4 (Stats)
