# Gametime Project Plan

Basketball simulation game — 40-team league with attribute-driven gameplay, season management, and a React frontend.

_Last updated: 2026-06-30_

## What Exists Today

### Shipped
- **21 player attributes**: agility, awareness, aggression, charisma, cohesion, composure, determination, ego, endurance, energy, handle, health, intelligence, luck, shotSelection, shotSkill, size, speed, strength, verticality, wingspan
- **23 derived skills** on a 1–20 / avg-10 scale via a shared deviation helper: acumen, ballSecurity, passing, teamOffense, drive, freeThrows, longRange, perimeter, post, individualDefense, teamDefense, offenseRebound, defenseRebound, finishing, transition, rimProtection, stealing, shotContest, foulDrawing, foulProne, clutch, screenSetting, offBallMovement
- **9 positions**: PG, CG, SG, W, SF, F, PF, FC, C
- **Player status** (availability): ACTIVE, INJURED, SUSPENDED. Lineup slot is a
  separate `lineupRole` (STARTER, ROTATION, BENCH, INACTIVE, MINORS) on the
  roster assignment — see decisions.md #013.
- **40-team league** across 4 conferences (EAST, NORTH, SOUTH, WEST), 422 seed players (CSV-driven via Liquibase)
- **Entity layer**: Player, Team, Coach (5 decision attributes — #018), GM (name only); player↔team decoupled via `player_team` + `player_team_hist`
- **Roster & lineup model**: a team's roster is part of the `Team` resource (`players` are roster entries with lineup slot); lineup (starting 5 + bench rotation order) is sticky state on `player_team`; player status (availability) is separate from lineup role; roster size caps (15 active / 5 minors) enforced on sign + lineup, signed players default to `INACTIVE`. Roster construction is unconstrained by position — no position minimums/maximums (#017). See decisions.md #013–#017.
- **REST endpoints**: GET league, GET player by ID + history, createPlayer, updatePlayer; GET team by ID (incl. roster), addPlayerToTeam, removePlayerFromTeam, set lineup
- **Skill calculation engine**: SkillCalculator interface, 23 calculator implementations, SkillMapper orchestrator
- **Entity-to-model mapping**: EntityMapper with full attribute + skill wiring
- **Database**: Postgres (local dev) + H2 (tests), Liquibase migrations, gametime schema, audit triggers
- **Test suite**: unit + Cucumber integration, 80% line coverage enforced (JaCoCo gate)
- **Build pipeline**: Multi-module Maven, OpenAPI codegen with delegate pattern, Docker Compose

### Deferred
- **GM attributes** — the name-only `GM` slot stays until its consumers are real
  (Phase 6.3 draft scouting / 6.4 trade evaluation). Resolve with the same
  continuous 1–20 model as coach (decisions.md #018); see coach.md open-Q #3.
  *(Coach attributes — done: Design Decision #3 resolved as #018, modeled
  end-to-end; see Shipped above.)*
- **Player age** — only `yearsPro` is modeled; no birth date / true age yet.
  `yearsPro` is sufficient for everything built so far; true age gains a consumer
  at Phase 6.1 (aging & development — attribute peak/decline curves), where the
  full date-of-birth model belongs.

## Phase 3 — Game Simulation Engine

**Goal**: Build the core possession-by-possession simulation.

### 3.1 Game Model ✓
- [x] Define `Game` entity: homeTeam, awayTeam, quarter structure, final score
- [x] Define `GameEvent` model: possessions, plays, outcomes
- [x] Define `BoxScore` model: per-player stats for a single game

_Shipped: `GameEntity` / `GameEventEntity` / `BoxScoreEntity` + repos, Liquibase
`release.1.0.4.game.sql`, persistence-only (no API surface — §3.6). See
decisions.md #020 and game.md for the modeling choices._

### 3.2 Possession Engine ✓
- [x] Possession flow: inbound → set play / fast break → shot clock → outcome
- [x] Shot selection logic: which player gets the ball, what type of shot (drive, perimeter, post, longRange)
- [x] Shot outcome: probability based on shooter skills vs defender skills
- [x] Turnover probability: ballSecurity vs defender individualDefense
- [x] Foul model: drive/post attempts → foul probability → freeThrow skill

_Shipped: `sim` package — `GameSimulator` @Service (transactional simulate()),
`PossessionEngine` (pure-sim loop), `ShotResolver`/`TurnoverResolver`/`FoulResolver`
(logistic-contest math per decisions.md #021), `ShotSelector` (skill-weighted),
`SimConfig` (all constants in one place for §3.4 tuning). Seeded RNG for
determinism. Missed shot ends possession (rebounding seam for §3.3). Starters
play the whole game (minutes/fatigue is §3.5). Assists left at 0 (§3.4).
Constants are placeholder starting points; §3.4 calibrates empirically._

### 3.3 Rebounding ✓
- [x] Offensive rebound probability: offenseRebound skills vs defenseRebound skills
- [x] Second-chance possessions

_Shipped: `ReboundResolver` @Component in the `sim` package (logistic-contest
`isOffensiveRebound()` per decisions.md #021 shape; skill-weighted
`pickOffensiveRebounder()`/`pickDefensiveRebounder()` mirroring `ShotSelector`).
`PossessionEngine.resolvePossession()` now resolves a rebound after every missed
shot: a `DEFENSIVE` rebound ends the possession, an `OFFENSIVE` rebound runs a
second-chance possession through the full flow (turnover → foul → shot), capped
at `SimConfig.MAX_OFFENSIVE_REBOUNDS_PER_POSSESSION` (a loop, not recursion).
`PlayType.REBOUND` is now live (outcomes `OFFENSIVE`/`DEFENSIVE`); box-score
offensive/defensive rebound counts are real (no longer hardcoded 0). Coach/
chemistry modifiers (§3.4), fatigue (§3.5), blocks, and team box-out are
deliberately out of scope — raw `offenseRebound` vs `defenseRebound` skills only.
`BASE_OFFENSIVE_REBOUND` is a placeholder (~0.27); §3.4 calibrates empirically._

### 3.4 Team Chemistry & Coaching Effects
- [ ] teamOffense/teamDefense affect overall team efficiency
- [ ] Passing skill influences assist rate and ball movement
- [ ] Acumen influences shot selection quality
- [ ] Coach system modifies possession pace, shot distribution, defensive scheme
- [ ] Rebalance skill calculator formulas once possessions exercise them
      (clutch/foulProne/transition etc. only get tested under real play)

### 3.5 Minutes, Fatigue & Substitution
*(gameplay, not roster — minutes/fatigue/coach rotation are produced by games
being played. Input: the `rotationOrder` bench depth chart already shipped in
the roster domain, #014.)*
- [ ] Minutes allocation: bench `rotationOrder` → distribution of playing time
- [ ] Per-player energy tracking within a game (`endurance` ↔ minutes played)
- [ ] Skill degradation as energy drops
- [ ] Automatic substitution triggers based on fatigue thresholds
- [ ] Coach rotation style determines when subs happen (gated on Coach model)

### 3.6 Simulation APIs
- [ ] `POST /v1/game/simulate` — simulate a single game, return box score
- [ ] `GET /v1/game/{gameId}` — retrieve game result
- [ ] `GET /v1/game/{gameId}/play-by-play` — event log
- [ ] Decide + migrate a stored per-event **time column** for play-by-play
      display (single value vs. range — deferred from §3.2, decisions.md #021)

### 3.x Deferred sim-fidelity details

Real-basketball events the §3.2/§3.3 engine deliberately does **not** model yet.
Each is correct to defer until a consumer cares about the distinction — adding
one now would fabricate event-log detail with no behavioral effect (the
#014/#017/#020 discipline: don't shape data ahead of a consumer). Listed here,
attached to the engine phase, so a future §3.4/§3.6/Phase 4 session finds them
instead of re-deriving or prematurely building them. Each notes its seam.

- [ ] **Missed shot out of bounds (no rebound).** A missed shot that sails OOB
      untouched, or a rebound tipped OOB, ends the possession the same as a
      defensive rebound — so today it's folded into the `REBOUND — DEFENSIVE`
      outcome. A distinct OOB outcome only matters once play-by-play *reads*
      differently (§3.6) or a ball-movement model (§3.4) produces deflections.
      Add then as a third branch off the rebound roll (retained vs lost inbound).
- [ ] **Loose-ball / rebounding fouls.** A foul committed *during* the rebound
      phase (box-out push, over-the-back). §3.3 only models shooting fouls on
      drive/post attempts; the rebound contest is foul-free. When added, it's a
      foul roll on the rebound contest → non-shooting foul (possession retained,
      or bonus free throws once a team-foul/bonus model exists). Gated on a
      team-foul-count model that doesn't exist yet.
- [ ] **And-1 / shooting foul on a made basket.** Today a foul check happens
      *instead of* a shot (drive/post → foul → 2 FTs), never *with* a made shot.
      A real and-1 is: made FG + 1 foul shot. Needs the foul model to roll
      alongside (not before) shot resolution. Belongs with §3.4's foul-model work.
- [ ] **Non-shooting turnovers with richer causes.** §3.2 models only `STOLEN` /
      `LOST_BALL`. Offensive fouls (charges), shot-clock violations, bad passes
      OOB, 3-seconds, etc. are deferred to the §3.4 ball-movement model.

## Phase 4 — Statistics & Box Scores

**Goal**: Track, aggregate, and expose stats.

### 4.1 Game Stats Model
- [ ] Per-game player stats: points, rebounds (off/def), assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, fouls, minutes, FGA/FGM, 3PA/3PM, FTA/FTM
- [ ] Per-game team stats: same aggregated, plus pace, efficiency rating
- [ ] Persist to database

### 4.2 Season Stats Aggregation
- [ ] Season averages per player
- [ ] Season totals per player
- [ ] Team season stats
- [ ] League leaders / rankings

### 4.3 Stats APIs
- [ ] `GET /v1/player/{playerId}/stats` — season stats
- [ ] `GET /v1/player/{playerId}/gamelog` — game-by-game log
- [ ] `GET /v1/team/{teamId}/stats` — team stats
- [ ] `GET /v1/league/leaders` — league leaders by category

---

## Phase 5 — Season Structure

**Goal**: Full season lifecycle — schedule, standings, playoffs, awards.

### 5.1 Schedule Generation
- [ ] Regular season: N games per team, balanced home/away
- [ ] Conference-weighted scheduling (more intra-conference games)
- [ ] Calendar-based game dates

### 5.2 Standings & Tiebreakers
- [ ] Win/loss record, conference record
- [ ] Division standings (if divisions are added within conferences)

- [ ] `POST /v1/season/{id}/simulate-all` — run entire season
- [ ] `GET /v1/season/{id}/standings` — current standings
- [ ] `GET /v1/season/{id}/schedule` — full schedule with results

---

## Phase 6 — Player Progression & Off-Season

**Goal**: Multi-season continuity with player development and aging.

### 6.1 Aging & Development
- [ ] Define age curves: when do attributes peak and decline?
- [ ] Young players: attribute growth between seasons based on yearsPro, determination, intelligence
- [ ] Veterans: gradual physical decline (speed, agility, energy) offset by mental gains (intelligence, shotSelection)
- [ ] Breakout/bust probability for young players

### 6.2 Injury System
- [ ] Injury probability model: `health` attribute, fatigue level, play type (drive/post riskier)
- [ ] Injury severity tiers: minor (miss games), moderate (miss weeks), major (miss season)
- [ ] Recovery and rehab affecting attributes on return
- [ ] Status transitions: ACTIVE <-> INJURED

### 6.3 Draft
- [ ] Generate draft class of rookies with semi-random attributes
- [ ] Draft order based on inverse standings
- [ ] Draft pick evaluation (GM scouting attribute affects accuracy of prospect assessment)

### 6.4 Free Agency & Trades
- [ ] Contract model: years, salary
- [ ] Salary cap
- [ ] Free agent signing period
- [ ] Trade logic: player-for-player, picks, salary matching
- [ ] GM attributes influence trade evaluation (model as continuous 1–20 like
      coach #018 — see coach.md open-Q #3)

---

## Phase 7 — React Frontend

**Goal**: Browser-based UI for viewing and interacting with the simulation.

### 7.1 Core Views
- [ ] League dashboard — all 40 teams by conference
- [ ] Team detail — roster, coach, GM, current record (surface coach attributes +
      a derived archetype label, computed on read — see coach.md open-Q #1)
- [ ] Player detail — attributes, skills radar chart, stats, game log
- [ ] Game view — box score, play-by-play

### 7.2 Season Views
- [ ] Standings page with conference tabs
- [ ] Schedule calendar
- [ ] Playoff bracket visualization

### 7.3 Management Views
- [ ] Lineup editor (drag-and-drop starters/bench)
- [ ] Roster management (add/drop/trade)
- [ ] Draft board

### 7.4 Simulation Controls
- [ ] "Simulate next game" / "Simulate day" / "Simulate week" buttons
- [ ] Season progress indicator
- [ ] Live game simulation with play-by-play feed (websocket or polling)

### 7.5 Tech Stack
- [ ] React + TypeScript
- [ ] Component library (TBD: Material UI, Tailwind, etc.)
- [ ] State management (TBD: React Query for server state, Context/Zustand for local)
- [ ] Chart library for player radar charts and stat visualizations

## Phase 8 — Polish & Advanced Features

**Goal**: Depth and replayability.

- [ ] Awards: MVP, Rookie of Year, All-League teams, Defensive Player of Year
- [ ] Historical records: track season-over-season stats
- [ ] Coach hiring/firing between seasons
- [ ] GM hiring/firing
- [ ] Player morale/chemistry system (charisma, cohesion, ego interactions)
- [ ] Home court advantage modifier
- [ ] Rivalry bonuses
- [ ] Pre-season / exhibition games
- [ ] All-Star game
- [ ] Export/import save state

## Design Decisions To Make

These are open questions that should be resolved before or during implementation:

1. **Simulation granularity**: Possession-by-possession (detailed, slow) vs. quarter-level (faster, less detail) vs. configurable?
2. **Game clock model**: Real seconds ticking down, or abstract possession count per quarter?
3. **Coach attribute design**: Continuous attributes (1-10 scale like players) or categorical styles (enum-based)?
4. **Salary/contract complexity**: Simple (flat salary, fixed years) or realistic (cap exceptions, bird rights, max contracts)?
5. **Draft class generation**: Fully random, template-based archetypes, or a mix?
6. **Frontend-first or API-first for new features?**: Build APIs then UI, or design UI mockups first?
7. **Real-time simulation**: Should game simulation stream play-by-play via WebSocket, or generate all at once and let the frontend replay?
8. **Multi-user**: Is this single-player (user controls one team) or spectator-mode (AI runs everything, user watches)?
9. **Persistence strategy for game events**: Store every possession in the DB, or only final box scores?
10. **Season length**: How many games per team per season? (NBA is 82 — that's a lot of simulation data)

## Suggested Build Order

The phases above are roughly sequential, but here's the critical path:

```
[Foundation ✓] ──> Phase 2 (Rosters) ✓ ──> Coach model ✓ ──> Phase 3 (Game Engine) ──> Phase 4 (Stats)
                                                        │
                                                        v
                                                Phase 5 (Season) ──> Phase 6 (Progression)
                                                        │
                                                        v
                                                Phase 7 (Frontend) ──> Phase 8 (Polish)
```

Phases 1-3 are the core loop. Once you can simulate a game and get a box score, everything else builds on top. The frontend can start in parallel with Phase 4+ once the game simulation API exists.
